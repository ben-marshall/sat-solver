# Overview

A brief description of the project.

---

This is a simple SAT solver based on the AC-3 Algorithm. It takes sets of
boolean expressions over a set of one or more variables, and computes whether
the expression(s) are *satisfiable*, that is: can be evaluated as true for
some set of inputs.
